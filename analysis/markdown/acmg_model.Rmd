## Introduction

This analysis is a summary of a model developed in May 2016.  The model was developed using data about typical carrier
frequencies for the ACMG56 conditions [@gm:17:197] plus internal Invitae data regarding the prevalence of
SNVs, indels, and CNVs in the pathogenic variant spectrum for each gene.
```{r warning=FALSE}
d <- load.model('../data/exome_acmg56_model.cleaned.csv')
d <- calculate.sensitivity(d,0.98,0.93,0.7)
plot.condition.carrier.freqs(d)
```

The above plot shows the carrier frequency data as collected by Ding, _et al_.
