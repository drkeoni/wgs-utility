	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released practice guidelines recommending reporting of incidental findings from exome and whole-genome sequencing by massively parallel (next-generation) sequencing for multiple conditions. Policy statements from other agencies are still being developed, and many attempt to take into consideration the predicted increase in workload caused by reporting incidental findings. We describe the effects of changing the sensitivity and the specificity, as well as the implications of varying diagnostic criteria and a priori prevalence, and those of increasing the number of included conditions, on rates of incidental findings. METHODS: We developed a simple mathematical model based on binomial probability for predicting rates of incidental findings. We primed and validated the model using published variant frequencies. RESULTS: The model correctly calculates observed rates of incidental findings. Changing the model's parameters shows that even minor changes in diagnostic criteria or sequencing accuracy cause large variation in rates of incidental findings. CONCLUSION: Our model correctly explains observed rates of incidental findings. Key drivers of rates include diagnostic criteria, variant frequency, disease penetrance, and sequencing and bioinformatics accuracy. Rates of incidental findings are relatively insensitive to even large increases in the number of conditions included.},

	Abstract = {Human cardiovascular malformations (CVMs) frequently have a genetic contribution. Through the application of novel technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, DNA sequence variants associated with CVMs are being identified at a rapid pace. While clinicians are now able to offer testing with NGS gene panels or whole exome sequencing to any patient with a CVM, the interpretation of genetic variation remains problematic. Variable phenotypic expression, reduced penetrance, inconsistent phenotyping methods, and the lack of high-throughput functional testing of variants contribute to these challenges. This article elaborates critical issues that impact the decision to broadly implement clinical molecular genetic testing in CVMs. Major benefits of testing include establishing a genetic diagnosis, facilitating cost-effective screening of family members who may have subclinical disease, predicting recurrence risk in offsprings, enabling early diagnosis and anticipatory management of CV and non-CV disease phenotypes, predicting long-term outcomes, and facilitating the development of novel therapies aimed at disease improvement or prevention. Limitations include financial cost, psychosocial cost, and ambiguity of interpretation of results. Multiplex families and patients with syndromic features are two groups where disease causation could potentially be firmly established. However, these account for the minority of the overall CVM population, and there is increasing recognition that genotypes previously associated with syndromes also exist in patients who lack non-CV findings. In all circumstances, ongoing dialog between cardiologists and clinical geneticists will be needed to accurately interpret genetic testing and improve these patients' health. This may be most effectively implemented by the creation and support of CV genetics services at centers committed to pursuing testing for patients.},
